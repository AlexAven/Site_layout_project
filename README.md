# Project Description

Hello! This is my training project.
I made an adaptive layout and UIkit.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run kit`

Opens UI kit.\
UI kit contains layout samples.
Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `www` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
